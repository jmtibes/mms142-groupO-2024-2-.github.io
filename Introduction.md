The television industry has long been observed as a cornerstone of entertainment and information dissemination since its emergence in the early 20th century. It began when experimental broadcasts in the 1920s evolved into a dominant medium by the mid-20th century (Media and Culture, n.d.), with families around the globe gathering in their living rooms to watch their favorite programs. This industry experienced a golden age in the 1950s due to the cost of TV sets dropping dramatically and making them accessible to a wider audience (Media and Culture, n.d.).

The television industry has come far in terms of its technological developments since the 1960s. One such development is the invention of the colored television, which eventually replaced black-and-white television in the 1970s. Another development is cable television, which first appeared in rural communities (Tucker, 2022). It then broadened its scope to reach national programs and a diverse range of channels. The switch from analog to digital television happened in 2009 which resulted in improved picture quality while simultaneously freeing up the broadcasting spectrum. In the next year, more than half of American residences had high-definition televisions that provided an experience similar to the cinemas (Media and Culture, n.d.). 

Despite its dominance, the traditional television industry now faces a new challenge as rapid advancements in Internet technology set the stage for a new era of content consumption. The challenger, Netflix, capitalized on these technological changes, introducing on-demand content that offered convenience and flexibility. Although Netflix began as a DVD rental service in 1997 (Netflix, n.d.), it has since grown to become a world leader in on-demand video streaming, radically changing the way people watch media. As a result, it has developed into a disruptive technology and became a serious threat to the established television industry.

It is because of such a situation that we would like to discuss Netflix and its disruptive influence on the traditional television industry. This report shall include a thorough analysis of Netflix as a disruptive technology and its impact on consumer viewing habits. It would also tackle the current situation of traditional television networks and their feedback on streaming services, particularly Netflix. The potential risks to media preservation caused by streaming platformsâ€™ digital-first approach are explored as well. However, the study is confined to the examination of Netflix as a representative case disruption and does not contain financial metrics or operational information of competing streaming platforms. Ultimately, this report offers insights into the revolutionization of the television industry caused by Netflix and its implications for the future of media consumption.
