In 2017, Netflix released an adventure show titled “Puss in Book: Trap in an Epic Tale” where they first launched their interactive fiction feature. Initially, their target audience was children, but then they saw its potential and began targeting adult viewers with the show “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.” This feature lets users control how the characters in the show respond, influencing the flow of the story. This became possible through the crucial role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays. It eases the modification of a storyline's progress. Aside from AI, Virtual Reality (VR) was also introduced on Netflix years ago, around 2016, when users watched content on Netflix while being in a virtual environment, like a simulated living room. These kinds of experiments that streaming platforms do prove that there are ways they explore new methods for how their media content engages effectively within the entertainment sector. Therefore, if AI and VR are utilized at the same time within a piece of content, there's a possibility it will not only alter the storyline but also affect how users experience the story. Additionally, if Netflix converges these two within its platform, it might set them apart from their competitors in the industry, especially traditional television. 

Netflix has numerous competitors in the industry. There are niche platforms such as Disney+, Prime Video, Crunchyroll, etc., which cater to different user preferences, and these platforms continue to grow. They might threaten Netflix's user loyalty if Netflix doesn't consider more hyper-personalized recommendations powered by AI and better localization of content. Additionally, the globalization of content that Netflix has been doing might be one of the trends that helped them expand their global subscriber base, setting them apart from regional television networks. As Netflix continues to target both global and local audiences, there’s another trend they might need to consider to acquire more users—applying some environmental practices within the platform. This way, Netflix could attract environmentally conscious individuals if they manage to market eco-friendly and sustainable measures within their platform.

Even though certain disadvantages have brought Netflix a positive impact on ratings, there are still areas where Netflix falls short—like a live feature. This is one of the advantages traditional television has, which is why it’s still relevant to this day. It could also explain why the older generation remains loyal to traditional television; its interface is simpler, and they’re more familiar with it. However, it’s the opposite for the younger generation. They prefer more digital streaming features. If these preferences of the younger generation are not met by traditional television, its relevance within the media sector could shrink. On the other hand, if traditional television steps out of its comfort zone and tries to adapt to modern societal preferences—like collaborating with streaming platforms—it could help them gain viewers rather than lose them.

Opportunities and risks are part of achieving a goal. One opportunity Netflix might be able to adopt in the future is enhancing its creativity with its content formats. Netflix has already done this before with the launch of its first interactive story feature, but it could be improved by going beyond what’s currently possible. This could attract tech-savvy individuals, who are often part of the younger generation. Experimenting with formats can be an advantage to gain more loyal viewers.






Conclusion

Today, Netflix has taken the world by storm. Due to the convenience of its services and their exclusive quality media productions and/or content, its popularity is increasing by the minute – new subscribers keep coming. In some households, it even has become a staple, a necessity – it has its share of the monthly budget, just like water, electric, and internet bills. Given these reasons, there’s no doubt that Netflix and similar streaming platforms disrupted and are currently disrupting the balance in the world of media. 

Although it has its pros, with convenience as its main desirable aspect (streaming anytime, anywhere), it has been mentioned that its downside includes the “expiry” or removal of some of the content in their platform after some time. If one of their exclusive contents gets removed or becomes unavailable on their platform, there won’t be any legal way to view that content any longer, unless it has been bought or licensed by another platform. Furthermore, Netflix currently doesn’t offer any live streaming service that television and other platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have. However, Netflix might address these weaknesses in the future, or if they move too slowly, they can be overtaken by another technology that would be developed in the future. 

The younger generation prefers modern streaming due to its convenience and the option to binge-watch content. On the other hand, many of the older generation still prefer the familiarity of the more traditional ways of consuming media which they grew up with. In the future, there’s a risk of traditional media becoming obsolete if it can’t adapt to the newer generation’s preferences. It’s also possible that Netflix and similar streaming platforms today will also be overtaken by newer technology someday, just like how these disrupted the way we consume media today. 

Our world, both physical and digital/virtual, has its life cycle. The old gets replaced by the new, and only a few get to withstand the test of time due to its “timelessness” or by gaining loyal audiences or customers. To survive, it is essential to adapt, evolve, and learn to address the weaknesses of a product, service, or technology.  What we may know today as disruptors will eventually become the norm, and there will be a rise of newer technologies that will then become the new “disruptors.”
