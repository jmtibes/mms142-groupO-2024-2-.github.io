Despite the drop of traditional television due to the escalating popularity of streaming, it stays alive to be essential for elderly audiences with high spending power through showing live events such as news, sports, and entertainment, sustaining an average of viewing four hours daily (Cablefax, 2024). To stay competitive, many traditional broadcasters are implementing modern technologies such as interactive TV and personalized advertisements. But of course, many viewers prefer streaming platforms because of the idea that they can watch multiple episodes of TV programs in one sitting over a short period (Sanusi & Ola, 2023). Additionally, streaming platforms offer the ability to watch entertainment, news, and sports whenever you want to, anytime and from anywhere in the world.

Before acknowledging the threat from streaming services like Netflix, traditional broadcasters are adopting streaming by partnering with popular platforms. Partnering with well-established services allows them to reach younger audiences and profit from older programs through content licensing agreements (Krizancic, 2023). These strategies endeavor to incorporate the adaptability and convenience of streaming with traditional benefits such as live programming. 

Traditional broadcast television has been dominated by the increasing number of streaming services like Netflix, which provides a more personalized, on-demand, and flexible viewing experience (Krizancic, 2023). However, amid these challenges, the experience of watching live TV broadcasts is still alive. The entertainment industry is going through a significant transformation as streaming services continue to evolve and grow in demand.
